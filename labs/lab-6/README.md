# Lab 6: Process Management

## Objective

---

## Steps

1. **Display all currently running processes**
   ```
   ps aux
   ```
-   Output

2. **Open a new terminal OR run a long-running command (sleep for 60 seconds)**
```
sleep 60 &
```
-   Output:
```
[1] 191591
```
-   Here 191591 is the PID.

3. **Find the process ID (PID) of your sleep command**

If you didnâ€™t note it from the previous step:
```
ps aux | grep sleep
```

4. **Kill the sleep process using its PID**
```
kill 191591
```

-   Ouput:

5. **Monitor system processes in real-time**

Using top:
```
top
```
-   Press q to quit.

-   Or, if htop is installed (more user-friendly):
```
htop
```
