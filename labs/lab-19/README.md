### Task 19.2: Display your PATH variable

-  The PATH variable tells Linux where to look for executables when you type a command.
```
echo $PATH
```
-  You should see directories separated by : (like /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin).

### Task 19.3: Add an alias to your .bashrc file

-  Aliases save time by shortening long commands.

-  Open .bashrc in nano (or your preferred editor):
```
nano ~/.bashrc
```
-  Add a line at the bottom. Example:
```
alias ll='ls -lah'
```

-  Save & exit (CTRL+O, ENTER, CTRL+X).

-  Reload .bashrc:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

-  Test your alias:
```
ll
```

### Task 19.4: Create a custom prompt 

-  The shell prompt is controlled by the PS1 variable. 
```
export PS1="student@devops:~$ "
```

-  To make it permanent, add it to your ~/.bashrc.

### Task 19.5: Test your customizations

-  Run ll to test your alias.

-  Open a new terminal â†’ see if your prompt and alias persist.
